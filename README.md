# Project Overview
I explored fundamental programming concepts in Python such as logic checks, data structures, and functions through interactive quizzes and practice on the computer. I used syntax, debugging techniques and basic problem-solving concepts.

### Project Objectives
* To Flex my newfound Python skills by taking a quiz that I build by myself!
* To Build this program will affirm my understanding of programming logic and functions, and serve as an excellent exercise in how to approach problem-solving.

### File
* `project.py`: an easy python math game
